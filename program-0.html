	   Program 0 - Observables

	   Our first few programs will all involve a simple counter. In this
	   one, the only UI for that counter will be a line logged to the console
	   when it is incremented.

	   The first of the techniques in MVC to control complexity is
	   keeping all state in one place, and make the code handling it
	   completely agnostic with respect to any views of the state. All
	   the state is maintained by an object referred to as the 'model'.
	   All views wanting to know about changing state register with the
	   model, and the model notifies all registered views when there is
	   a change. This register and notify structure goes under the name
	   of the 'observer pattern.'

	   We create an Observable object to act as the prototype of models.
	   All observers must have a method called 'update' that is invoked
	   when the observable notifies them.
	 */

	var Observable = {
		initializeObservable: function() {
			this.observers = new Set();
		},

		addObserver: function(observer) {
			this.observers.add(observer);
		},

		deleteObserver: function(observer) {
			this.observers.delete(observer);
		},

		notify: function() {
			this.observers.forEach(function(observer) {
				observer.update();
			});
		}
	};

	/*
	   Here is our model. For creating one-off objects with a particular
	   prototype, this is the general pattern: invoke Object.create, then
	   set fields on the object.
	 */
	var Counter = Object.create(Observable);
	Counter.initializeObservable();
	Counter.count = 0;
	Counter.increment = function() {
		this.count += 1;
		this.notify();
	};

	/*
	   Finally, we need a trivial observer.
	 */
	var LogCounter = {
		update: function() {
			console.log('Count is ' + Counter.count);
		}
	};
	Counter.addObserver(LogCounter);

	/*
	   In our next example we will start creating actual UI to interact
	   with, but for now drive this from the console by invoking
	   Counter.increment();
